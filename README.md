## Challenge
We are going to build the Pokedex for the original 150 Pokemon using the [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/) using React. The requirements of this challenge are for you to:
- Create an API layer that reaches out to Poke API to get all of the Pokemon and to get details about each Pokemon (a photo, and their Pokemon type)
- `/pokemon` should make a call to the Poke API and list out all 150 Pokemon
- `/pokemon/ID` should make a call to the Poke API and list out the details of that Pokemon (a photo, their type, their attacks, and whatever else you want to add)
- `/pokemon/search` should display a form for the User to be able to look up a Pokemon by name and call out to the Poke API to get results returned

No points will be deducted if it's ugly but it'd be nice if it looked nice.
